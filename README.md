### Notes
- Astable Circuit = no stable state = continually switches state between high and low without without any intervention from the user, called a 'square' wave
- Monostable mode = one stable state = produces one pulse of a set length in response to a trigger input such as a push button, will automatically switch off after a set time.
- Bistable Mode  = 2 stables state
